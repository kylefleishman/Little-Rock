public class notes : MonoBehaviour
{
    // ty cat like coding
    // no stair functionality from tutorial (skipped)
    // same for wall jumping and air jumping / double jumping
    // we set our layer as climbable, could work vice verse to to set an unclimable one and make everything climable by default, set to check of layer is climable or not currently
    // maybe add planetary gravity? would involve wrapping marched cube meshes around uv sphere in cat like coding
    // how the fuck would perlin noise even work then?
    // expand upon staminaBar for climbing and running

    // you will find we have inputs for diving, but the functionality is commented out
    // unsure if it aligns with idea of game in mind

    // we make see-through objects invisible when they obstruct the view, maybe worthwhile
